# stm32-esp8266-clientMode
 Client Mode esp8266 with stm32
 
 By configuring the esp8266 in client mode, it connects to the targeted esp8266 and sends the desired message to the esp8266 in AP mode using the TCP-IP communication protocol. 
 In the project, two separate esp8266 devices, programmed with stm32, are used for client mode and AP mode respectively.
 They have been uploaded to separate repositories.
 
 This section contains the code that configures and sends a message using the esp8266 module located next to the baby after detecting sound.
 
 The main objective of the project is to trigger an alarm for the parent in a different location when a baby cries, using a sound detection module. 
 For this purpose, communication between two microcontrollers is established using esp8266.
